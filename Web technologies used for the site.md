Web Technologies Used for Bright Huaman Website

Based on the provided HTML and CSS code, the following web technologies are being used to build the Bright Huaman website:

**1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**
   - Used to structure the content and elements of each webpage.
   - Defines the text, images, links, forms, and other components that make up the site.
   - Provides the semantic meaning to the content, indicating headings, paragraphs, navigation, etc.

**2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**
   - Used to control the visual presentation of the HTML elements.
   - Defines the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other stylistic aspects of the website.
   - Separates the design from the content, making it easier to maintain and update the site's appearance.
   - The provided CSS code includes rules for:
     - Global styles (font, background, text color).
     - Header and navigation (logo, menu, layout).
     - Hero section (homepage content).
     - About page specific styles.
     - Portfolio page layout (gallery).
     - Contact page form and information.
     - Footer.
     - Basic responsiveness (implied through units like `%` and `vw`, though no explicit media queries are shown).

**3. JavaScript:**
   - Used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website.
   - The provided JavaScript code (`script.js`) includes functionality for:
     - Smooth scrolling from the "View My Work" button on the homepage to the portfolio page (though the logic redirects to the portfolio page).
     - Basic client-side form validation for the contact form.

**4. Font Awesome:**
   - A library of icons that can be easily embedded in the website.
   - Used for the phone and email icons in the "Get in Touch" section of the contact page.
   - Included via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) link in the `<head>` of each HTML file.

**5. Image Files (JPEG, PNG):**
   - Used to display visual content on the website.
   - Examples include the logo (`letter of B.jpg`), header images (`Untitled_Panorama-1.jpg`), and portfolio project images (`04Start1-Recovered.png`, `IMG_0519.jpg`, `Screenshot 2025-04-24 114816.png`, `IMG_0330.JPG`).

**In summary, the website utilizes fundamental front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) along with the Font Awesome icon library and image files to create its structure, styling, and basic interactivity.**
